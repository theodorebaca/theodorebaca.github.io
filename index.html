        <p>I created this website so it could act as a nicely laid out memory for a future me. I love guitars and I was very heavy on buying, selling, and trading them. Lately, I have not been able to do it nearly as much, but that doesn't mean that I still
          don't enjoy aquiring new guitars or any instrument for that matter. This website will serve as a overview of the guitars I have and currently do own, just so down the road, I can look at it and remember everyone of them.</p>

        <p>To accompany this Home page, I have created three additional pages. The first is an About Me page that just gives a quick look at who I am. The second is a Collection page which shows a picture of each of my guitars and gives some detail on it.
          Lastly, I added a contact page in case you wanted to get in touch.</p>
