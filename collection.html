        <h3>Ibanez RGT2020 Prestige</h3>

        <p>This is my main guitar. It holds a special place in my heart, probably because it was my first nice guitar. Although it looks banged up and worn, it plays amazingly! I acquired it around 3 years ago and it was my first Ibanez Prestige (one of
          my favorite lines of guitars).</p>

        <h3>Ibanez S5521 Prestige</h3>
        <p>Here we have an Ibanez S5521 Prestige. This guitar was crafted in Japan, much like the previous guitar. However, it is much newer. This guitar was manufactured in 2015 and I purchased it new for around $1500. This thing is absolutely killer, however,
          I do not use it nearly as much as my RGT2020.</p>

        <h3>M2M Custom Strandberg</h3>
        <p>This is a custom shop Strandberg! It was made in Sweden and is a Made2Measure model. Basically, it is custom specs! At the time this was made, it cost around $5000, as crazy as that sounds. 
        I actually bought this guitar used and acquired it for around $3000, which is still steep. This is a 7 string as well.</p>

        <h3>Washburn Strandberg Boden 7</h3>
        <p>This was my first Strandberg. It is a Boden 7 made by the Washburn factory in the USA. It is an amazing guitar and one of the best 7 strings I have ever picked up! The top is figured claro walnut 
        which looks and sounds great. The neck is an endurneck.</p>
