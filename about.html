        <p>My name is Theodore Baca. I was born in Victorville, CA back in 1995. I always found this city, and the surrounding ones for that matter, to be extremely boring and unfulfilling. While in Middle School, I frequently found myself bored. Sure, I
          had my friends and my school work, but when I wasn't hanging out or studying, I had nothing to do. It wasn't till I was hanging out with a group of friends who played guitar that I had realized my calling. That day, when we ran out of things
          to do, the three of them picked up instruments and just started jamming together. I sat on the couch in awe as I watched them strum on the guitars. I instantly knew what I wanted to do. What my next hobby would be.</p>

        <p>I started actually playing the guitar at age 15. I started on a cheap $50 acoustic and quickly outgrew it. However, I had a poor family and they were not able to afford anything better at the time. Luckily, for Christmas, my Grandfather but me
          a much nicer acoustic for me to continue my playing. I was hooked. I wanted more and more guitars. I ended up doing what ever work I could in order to aquire them. As time went on, I got more and more guitars. I earned more money and started
          a collection. This collection is shown in the Collection page linked at the top!</p>
